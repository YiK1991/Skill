# PDCA Skill Refinements - Version 1.1

After carefully re-reading the InfoQ article, I've refined the skill to better match the author's intent and emphasis. Here are the key improvements:

## Major Refinements

### 1. **Plan is FOR the AI** (Critical Fix)
**What Changed:** Planning prompt now explicitly states the plan is "optimized for YOUR use as context for the implementation"

**Why:** The article emphasizes that the plan is primarily for the AI agent to use during execution, not just for human review. This is a critical distinction that makes the AI more effective at maintaining coherence through long sessions.

**Article Quote:** *"Planning Phase. Based on our analysis, provide a coherent plan incorporating our refinements that is optimized for your use as context for the implementation."*

### 2. **Working Agreements as Separate Reference**
**What Changed:** Created dedicated `working-agreements.md` reference file instead of having it inline in SKILL.md

**Why:** 
- Keeps SKILL.md lean (skill creation best practice)
- Allows working agreements to be loaded separately
- More detailed than what fits in main skill
- Can be read independently at session start

**Improvements:**
- More detailed intervention questions
- Explicit quality standards
- Session discipline guidelines
- Clearer purpose and rationale

### 3. **Model Selection Tagging**
**What Changed:** Added optional model selection complexity tagging to planning steps

**Why:** The article discusses tagging steps for optimal model selection. While not core to the process, this enables cost optimization by using lighter models for simple steps and reserving capable models for complex reasoning.

**Article Context:** *"Each step tagged for optimal model selection within the same thread context"* and discussion of Sonnet vs Haiku usage.

### 4. **Emphasis on Human Control in Retrospective**
**What Changed:** Added explicit note that retrospective should focus on what the HUMAN can change (prompts, process, behavior)

**Why:** The article emphasizes "I focus on what I can change in the prompt language, process, and my behavior, because those are the only levers I can control to improve results."

**Impact:** Keeps retrospectives actionable and prevents blaming the AI for issues.

### 5. **Artifact Creation for Project Tracking**
**What Changed:** Added notes that analysis and completion outputs should be suitable for Jira/Linear

**Why:** The article explicitly mentions: *"The Plan and Check steps produce artifacts that I add to the Jira Stories we use to track work. This practice creates transparency, and explainability with low overhead."*

**Benefit:** Outputs are now designed to be copy-pasted directly into project management tools.

### 6. **"No TODO from Test Driving" Specificity**
**What Changed:** Completion check now says "No TODO/FIXME comments remaining created by this test driving session"

**Why:** The article's exact phrasing is more precise - we care about TODOs created during THIS session, not pre-existing ones.

**Impact:** Clearer definition of done for the session.

### 7. **Batching Strategy Clarity**
**What Changed:** Better explanation of why batching is used in implementation

**Why:** The article explains batching reduces inference costs while accommodating AI's strength at producing complete blocks of working code rather than minimal changes.

**Quote:** *"The red-green refactor discipline addresses AI's tendency to create overly complex scenarios or skip test-first entirely. Batching reduces inference costs while accommodating AI's strength at producing complete blocks of working code."*

## Minor Refinements

### Improved Transparency Requirements
- Stronger emphasis on showing reasoning before each step
- Test output offloaded to files (concise summary + RefSpec in session; full logs in scratch/test_runs)
- Clearer intervention triggers

### Context Drift Detection
- Added specific signs: "going off on tangents, duplicating code, or ignoring established patterns"
- Clearer guidance on when to stop and replan

### Quality Metrics Alignment
- Verified all 5 metrics match article exactly
- Clarified targets and measurement approach
- Aligned with author's GitHub Actions implementation

## What Stayed the Same (By Design)

### Core Structure
- 5-phase PDCA workflow (Plan-Plan-Do-Check-Act)
- TDD discipline with red-green-refactor
- Progressive disclosure through reference files
- Metrics tracking and session logging

### Philosophy
- Human accountability emphasis
- Small batch sizes
- Existing pattern reuse
- Continuous improvement through retrospectives

## Files Added

1. **references/working-agreements.md** - Comprehensive working agreements document

## Files Updated

1. **SKILL.md** - Streamlined, points to working agreements reference
2. **references/planning-prompt.md** - Added "for YOUR use" and model selection
3. **references/analysis-prompt.md** - Added artifact creation note
4. **references/completion-prompt.md** - Clarified "TODO from test driving"
5. **references/retrospective-prompt.md** - Added human control emphasis

## Validation Against Article

| Article Element | Skill Implementation | Status |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Working Agreements | references/working-agreements.md | ✅ Enhanced |
| Analysis with codebase search | references/analysis-prompt.md | ✅ Complete |
| Plan optimized for AI use | references/planning-prompt.md | ✅ Fixed |
| TDD with batching | references/implementation-prompt.md | ✅ Complete |
| Completion analysis | references/completion-prompt.md | ✅ Enhanced |
| Micro-retrospectives | references/retrospective-prompt.md | ✅ Enhanced |
| Quality metrics | scripts/track_metrics.py | ✅ Complete |
| 1-3 hour sessions | Throughout | ✅ Complete |
| Jira artifacts | Analysis/Completion prompts | ✅ Added |
| Model selection | Planning prompt | ✅ Added |

## Usage Impact

### For Users
- **Clearer workflow**: Working agreements as separate reference makes them more accessible
- **Better AI performance**: "Plan for YOUR use" helps AI maintain coherence
- **More actionable retrospectives**: Focus on human-controllable changes
- **Ready for teams**: Artifacts designed for project tracking integration

### For Implementation
- **More accurate to article**: Key nuances now captured
- **Better documentation**: Separation of concerns between SKILL.md and references
- **Progressive disclosure**: Lean SKILL.md with detailed references

## Skill Size Comparison

- **Version 1.0**: 46,599 bytes (9 files)
- **Version 1.1**: ~50,000 bytes (10 files - added working-agreements.md)

The slight size increase is worth it for the improved structure and accuracy to the article.

## Next Steps for Users

If you already installed v1.0:
1. Re-download the new `SKILL.md` file
2. Re-upload to Claude.ai (overwrites the old version)
3. Read the new `working-agreements.md` reference for enhanced detail

If this is your first install:
1. Upload `SKILL.md` to Claude.ai
2. Start with "Load references/working-agreements.md" in your first session
3. Follow the Quick Start workflow

## Confidence in Article Accuracy

After re-reading and cross-referencing every major point in the article, I'm confident this skill now captures:
- ✅ All core PDCA workflow elements
- ✅ Critical nuances (plan for AI, human control focus)
- ✅ Practical details (batching, model selection, artifacts)
- ✅ Quality standards and metrics
- ✅ Author's emphasis on accountability and improvement

The skill is now a high-fidelity implementation of the article's framework.
